                <p>The vast majority of CS:GO players are focused on getting better at aiming.
                    Being able to click on heads really well is the sexiest aspect of the gameâ€”everyone wants to be like
                    KRiMZ or GeT_RiGhT and wire impossible, highlight reel-worthy headshots.</p>

                <p>In actuality, the vast majority of CS:GO players would benefit most from focusing on improving the
                    way they move, on adopting new techniques, on learning how movement influences accuracy, when and
                    when not to crouch, and so on.</p>

                <p>Movement is an easy thing to take for granted, but like most areas of Counter-Strike, movement is
                    its own discipline, something that takes a mixture of techniques, knowledge, and intuition do do well.
                    Forcing yourself to sit through a few minutes of video tutorials can unlock some epiphanies about
                    bad habits and how to take your game to the next level.
                    To that end, I've collected some recommended videos on movement below.</p>
